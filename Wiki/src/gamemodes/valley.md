**Valley** is a fictional modern-era map in development, designed for tactical combat and deep role-playing (RP). Set in the Blugoslavia-Redmenia universe of Civ13, focusing on a conflict-ravaged border region, it pits organized military forces against local insurgents, with a neutral UN presence adding complexity. The map emphasizes strategy, terrain mastery, and faction-specific objectives, making every skirmish a test of wits and coordination.

## Factions

### Blugoslavia

Blugoslavian forces have crossed the southeastern border of Greenistan, advancing past the Teelekum Mountains to secure their frontier amid the Greenistani Civil War. The elite 21st Rifle Brigade leads the operation, equipped with cutting-edge Blugoslavian weaponry, including advanced rifles, drones, and armored vehicles.

-   **Strengths**: Superior firepower, disciplined command structure, and modern equipment.
-   **Weaknesses**: Limited knowledge of the local terrain and vulnerability to ambushes.
-   **Role-Playing Notes**: Blugoslavian players should focus on maintaining supply lines and coordinating large-scale assaults while navigating hostile territory.

### Greenistani Insurgents

With no centralized Greenistani government to resist the invasion, local warlords and civilians have formed a decentralized insurgency to repel the Blugoslavian occupiers. Operating in small, autonomous bands, the insurgents rely on guerrilla tactics and intimate knowledge of the terrain.

-   **Strengths**: Mastery of the mountainous landscape, access to hidden underground bases, and secret tunnels for flanking or retreating.
-   **Weaknesses**: Obsolete weapons (old rifles, improvised explosives) and inferior equipment compared to Blugoslavia.
-   **Role-Playing Notes**: Insurgents thrive on hit-and-run tactics, sabotage, and blending into civilian populations. Coordinate strikes carefully to avoid UN intervention.

### United Nations

The United Nations Greenistan Assistance Force (UNGAFOR) operates a humanitarian mission in the Valley, providing civilian relief and running a field hospital. Neutral in the conflict, UNGAFOR offers medical aid to combatants from both sides but enforces a **strict no-weapons policy** within UN-controlled areas.

-   **Key Policies**:
    -   Armed combatants attempting to enter UN installations will face lethal force.
    -   UN forces are defensive, only engaging if fired upon or to protect civilians.
    -   UNGAFOR may intervene to safeguard non-combatants caught in crossfire.
-   **Strengths**: Well-equipped defensive positions, advanced medical facilities.
-   **Weaknesses**: Limited manpower and a mandate restricting proactive engagement.
-   **Role-Playing Notes**: UN players must balance neutrality with protecting civilians, often mediating tense encounters or managing chaotic refugee situations.

## Victory Conditions

### Blugoslavia

Blugoslavia earns points through logistical and territorial control to secure the Valley. Victory is achieved by reaching **1000 points** or having the most points when the match timer (50 minutes) expires.

-   **Supply Box Deliveries**: Transport supply boxes from the FOB to any of the four checkpoints. Each delivery earns **50 points**. Boxes must be secured at a checkpoint uncontested for 30 seconds.
-   **Holding Checkpoints**: Control a checkpoint (no insurgents in its radius) to earn **5 points per checkpoint per minute**. Holding all four checkpoints simultaneously grants a **100-point bonus** every 5 minutes.

### Greenistani Insurgents

Insurgents earn points by eliminating Blugoslavian forces, disrupting their operations. Victory is achieved by reaching **1000 points** or having the most points when the match timer (50 minutes) expires.

-   **Kills**: Earn **30 points** per Blugoslavian soldier killed.
-   **Disrupting Operations**: Additional points may be earned by stealing supply boxes and bringing them to the base: **75 points per box**. Destroying boxes earns no points but denies the enemy theirs.

### United Nations

The UN cannot "win" the scenario per se, but their own independent objectives are ensuring 80% civilian NPC survival rate and maintain control of the hospital zone without violating neutrality.

## The Map

The Valley map is a rugged, desert mountainous region dotted with strategic locations that shape the conflict:

-   **Teelekum Mountains**: A natural barrier with narrow passes, ideal for insurgent ambushes but challenging for Blugoslavian vehicles.
-   **Underground Passages**: Hidden tunnels used by insurgents for surprise attacks or escapes, inaccessible to Blugoslavian heavy units.
-   **UN Hospital Zone**: A fortified neutral area in the map’s East. No weapons are allowed inside.
-   **Blugoslavian Forward Base**: A well-defended outpost with supply caches, serving as the staging ground for their operations, located in the North-West of the map.

-   **Terrain Tips**:
    -   Insurgents: Use tunnels to outmaneuver Blugoslavians.
    -   Blugoslavia: Secure open ground for supply deliveries and avoid narrow passes.
    -   UN: Maintain clear lines of sight around the hospital to enforce the no-weapons zone. Protect civilians from being killed in the crossfire.
