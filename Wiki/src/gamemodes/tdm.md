## Gamemodes

Even though all Team Death Match game modes feature two or more teams fighting eachother, there are different victory conditions. They can be broadly divided into Symmetric, Asymmetric, King-of-the-Hill and Points-Based. These will be detailed below.

### Symmetric

This could also be called classic: in this game mode, each team defends its base and captures the opponentâ€™s base.

### Asymmetric

Basically siege mode - one team has to defend a point for X minutes, while the attacker has to capture this point for Y minutes to win.

### King of the Hill

All teams compete to capture a single objective. This is normally located in the centre of the map.

### Points-based

Each team has different conditions they need to meet in order to win. This is highly map-specific, it could be gaining points from holding an area, for kills, for capturing enemies, and so on.

## Current Maps

Below is a list of the current maps, and a brief description:

### Medieval

-   **Camp:** A small KotH map. French and English soldiers compete for the control of a castle, located in the centre of the map.

### WW2

-   **Opushka:** A small KotH map. Germans and Soviets fight for the control of a ruined house in the centre of the map.

### Cold War

-   **Hotel:** A medium Asymmetric map. The Soviets defend a command post located in a Hotel in the Ural mountains, which the Americans have to assault.

### Modern

-   **Valley:** Work in Progress! A medium-sized, tactical point-based map set in the fictional universe of the Blugoslavian-Redmenian conflict, Blugoslavian forces fighting Greenistani insurgents while the UN watches. Has its own article, [Valley](valley.md).
