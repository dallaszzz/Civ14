# Team Deathmatch

## Gamemodes

Even though all Team Death Match game modes feature two or more teams fighting eachother, there are different victory conditions. They can be broadly divided into Symmetric, Asymmetric, King-of-the-Hill and Points-Based. These will be detailed below.

### Symmetric

This could also be called classic, in this game mode each team has to defend their base and capture the opponents'.

### Asymmetric

Basically siege mode - one team has to defend a point for X minutes, while the attacker has to capture this point for Y minutes to win.

### King of the Hill

All teams compete to capture a single objective. This is normally located in the centre of the map.

### Points-based

Each team has different conditions they need to meet in order to win. This is highly map-specific, it could be gaining points from holding an area, for kills, for capturing enemies, and so on.

## Current Maps
